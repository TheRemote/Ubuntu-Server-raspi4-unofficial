# Script that fixes an Ubuntu 20.04 / 20.10 partition created by the official Raspberry Pi Imager to boot with a Raspberry Pi 4
# by James A. Chambers - https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-4-ubuntu-20-04-usb-mass-storage-boot-guide

# First image your drive with Ubuntu 20.04 or 20.10 using the official Pi Imager tool
# Next connect your drive to the Raspberry Pi
# Find drive using lsblk (normally it's /dev/sda but check first) -- unmount if it was automatically mounted with sudo umount mountpoint (ex: sudo umount /media/pi/system-boot)
# Mount boot partition with sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
# Mount writable partition with sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/writable
# Now you are ready to run this script to update the partition for Raspberry Pi booting

# First find the "writable" root filesystem mount
if [ -d /mnt/writable ] && [ -e /mnt/writable/usr/lib/u-boot/rpi_4/u-boot.bin ]; then
    mntWritable='/mnt/writable'
else
    echo "The partition 'writable' was not found in /mnt/writable.  Make sure you have mounted your USB mass storage device."
    exit 1
fi
echo "Found writable partition at $mntWritable"

# Find the "system-boot" boot filesystem mount
if [ -d /mnt/boot ] && [ -e /mnt/boot/vmlinuz ]; then
    mntBoot='/mnt/boot'
else
    echo "The 'boot' partition was not found in /mnt/boot.  Make sure you have mounted your USB mass storage device."

# The unusual ordering below is deliberate; older firmwares (in particular the
# version initially shipped with bionic) don't understand the conditional
# [sections] below and simply ignore them. The Pi4 doesn't boot at all with
# firmwares this old so it's safe to place at the top. Of the Pi2 and Pi3, the
# Pi3 uboot happens to work happily on the Pi2, so it needs to go at the bottom
# to support old firmwares.
