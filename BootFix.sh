# Script that fixes an Ubuntu 20.04 / 20.10 partition created by the official Raspberry Pi Imager to boot with a Raspberry Pi 4

# First image your drive with Ubuntu 20.04 or 20.10 using the official Pi Imager tool
# Next connect your drive to the Raspberry Pi
# Find drive using lsblk (normally it's /dev/sda but check first) -- unmount if it was automatically mounted with sudo umount mountpoint (ex: sudo umount /media/pi/system-boot)
# Mount boot partition with sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
# Mount writable partition with sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/writable
# Now you are ready to run this script to update the partition for Raspberry Pi booting

# Safety check, check for /boot directory and /usr/bin/raspinfo - NO LONGER USED - See Issue #140
